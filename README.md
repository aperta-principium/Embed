# Embed
Embed just about anything... in the browser

[Demo](https://embed.filiptronicek.now.sh/)

First include the script
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/filiptronicek/Embed/embed.js"> </script>
```

Then just create a div
```html
<div id="embed"> </div>
```
and set the link
```html
<script> 
Embed("https://github.com/filiptronicek.png");
</script>
```
And you're done!
